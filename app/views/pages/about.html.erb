      <p>Hi &#x1f44b</p></br> 
      <p>I'm Lone, and I am the maker of this tool.</p></br>
      <p>I reside in Copenhagen, where I work with product management. In that role, I often facilitate different kinds of creative processes, which is something I really enjoy!</p> </br>
      <p>During the covid-19 lockdown, when everything suddenly had to be online, I realized how much extra effort you have to put into remote facilitation, and I wanted to do something about it!</p></br>
      <p>I decided to make a tool that facilitators would love! &#x2728 <p></br>
      <p>What I wanted to achieve was to: </p></br>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-10">
        <li class="mb-2">make it really easy to get started - you should be able to start brainstorming in the blink of an eye &#x1F441</li>
         <li class="mb-2">make the whole process tailored - you shouldn't spend too much time thinking about how to facilitate a session, but rather focus on what you want to do &#x1F680</li>
        <li>make the experience of brainstorming light and fun - the best ideas come when people are having a good time &#x1F389</li>
      </ul></br>
      <p>What do you think? &#x1F496</p></br>
      <p><a class="underline hover:bg-yellowy" href="mailto:brainstormer.online@gmail.com?subject=Hi Lone! This is what Brainstormer needs for it to be truly lovable!">Let me know</a> what I can do to improve Brainstormer.</p></br></br>
      <p>Best regards,</p>
      <p>Lone Kjeldgaard Pedersen</p>
